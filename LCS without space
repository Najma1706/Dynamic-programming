Dr. Maya, a bioinformatics researcher, is analyzing protein sequences to study evolutionary relationships between different species. She is comparing two protein sequences, proteinA and proteinB, to identify key similarities and repetitions.



Dr. Maya needs to determine:



The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) shared by both protein sequences. This will highlight the longest sequence of amino acids that appears in both proteinA and proteinB in the same order, though not necessarily consecutively.

The number of times the LCS appears as a subsequence within proteinA. This will help her quantify how frequently the common sequence is present in one of the proteins.



Can you assist Dr. Maya by writing a program to calculate the LCS and count its occurrences in proteinA?

Input format :
The first line of input contains a string representing proteinA.

The second line of input contains a string representing proteinB.

Output format :
The first line of output displays the length of the longest common subsequence.

The second line of output displays the number of times the LCS appears as a subsequence in proteinA.

The third line of output displays the longest common subsequence.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ len(proteinA), len(proteinB) ≤ 1000

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
ABCDGH
AEDFHR
Output 1 :
3
1
ADH
Input 2 :
AAAAAA
AAXAAA
Output 2 :
5
6
AAAAA
