Given an integer array of coins[] of size N representing different types of currency and an integer sum, The task is to find the number of ways to make the sum by using different combinations from coins[].  



Note: Assume that you have an infinite supply of each type of coin. 

Input format :
The first line contains a single integer n, which represents the size of the array.

The second line contains n space-separated integers, which represent the coins available.

The third line contains a single integer s, which represents the target sum.

Output format :
The output consists of a single integer, which represents the number of ways in which the target sum can be achieved using the given coins.

Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 100 (Number of different coin denominations)

1 ≤ coins[i] ≤ 1000 (Each coin denomination value)

1 ≤ s ≤ 1000 (Target sum to be formed)

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
3
1 2 3
3
Output 1 :
3
Input 2 :
3
1 2 3
4
Output 2 :
4

// You are using GCC
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int n;
    cin>>n;
    vector<int> coins(n);
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
        cin>>coins[i];
    }
    int t;
    cin>>t;
    vector<int>dp(t+1,0);
    dp[0]=1;
    for(int coin:coins){
        for(int j=coin; j<=t; j++) {
            dp[j]+=dp[j-coin];
        }
    }
    cout<<dp[t];
}
