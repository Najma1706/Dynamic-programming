Problem Statement
Olivia is comparing two historical manuscripts, manuscript1 and manuscript2, and wants to determine the minimum cost required to transform manuscript1 into manuscript2 by performing a series of operations. These operations can be insertion, deletion, or substitution of characters, each with a specific cost. The cost of each operation is given as input. Write a program to calculate the minimum cost of transforming one manuscript into another.

Input format :
The first line of input contains the string m1, representing manuscript 1.

The second line of input contains the string m2, representing manuscript 2.

The third line of input contains three integers representing the costs of the operations: insertion, deletion, and substitution.

Output format :
The output prints the integer representing the minimum cost required to transform manuscript1 into manuscript2.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ string length of m1, m2 ≤ 100

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
book
back
4
3
5
Output 1 :
10
Input 2 :
history
mystery
2
3
4
Output 2 :
12
